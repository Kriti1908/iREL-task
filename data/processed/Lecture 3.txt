Sequence of sets
▶Given (Ω, F), If A1 ⊂A2 . . . is an increasing sequence of
events defined on F and ∪∞
n=1An = A ∈F, then we say thats
the sequence of sets An are increasing to A (An ↑A).
▶Similarly when A1 ⊃A2 . . . is a decreasing sequence of events
and ∩∞
n=1An = A, then we have An ↓A.
▶Alternative notation: For an increasing sequence of sets An we
often write lim
n→∞An for ∪∞
n=1An and for a decreasing sequence
of sets An that lim
n→∞An = ∩∞
n=1An.

Continuity of set-function P
Lemma
For sequence of events of the type An ↑A or An ↓A, we have
lim
n→∞P(An) = P(A).
Proof
▶Consider increasing sequence first. Similar arguments follow
for decreasing seq.
▶Define Fn = An −An−1
▶∪∞
n=1An = ∪∞
n=1Fn.
▶P(A) = P(∪∞
n=1An) = P(∪∞
n=1Fn)
▶But P(∪∞
n=1Fn) = limn→∞
Pn
i=1 P(Fi) = limn→∞P(An).
Equivalently if An →∅, then P(An) →0.

Conditional probability

outcome is 1?
▶Given/If ¯ω ∈[0, 0.5] what is the probability that ¯ω ∈[0, 0.25]?
The conditional probability of event B given event A is defined
as P(B/A) := P(A∩B)
P(A)
when P(A) > 0.

Conditional probability – Examples
▶Suppose you draw 4 cards from a deck at random without
replacement. What is the probability that (in order) these
cards are 9 of club, 8 of diamond, king of spade and king of
club?
▶What if you do the above with replacement?
▶Consider a finite sample space Ωwhere each outcome is
equally likely. Then what is P(B/A)?
▶P(B/A) = |A∩B|
|A| .

Law of total probability
▶A = (A ∩B) ∪(A ∩Bc). What is P(A)?
▶P(A) = P(A ∩B) + P(A ∩Bc).
▶This is same as P(A) = P(A/B)P(B) + P(A/Bc)P(Bc).
▶This formula is useful when P(A) is not given or is difficult to
find but P(B) or P(A/B) is readily available.
Let B1, B2, . . . Bn be the partition of the sample space Ω.
Then for any event A we have
P(A) =
n
X
i=1
P(A ∩Bi) =
n

i=1
P(A/Bi)P(Bi).

Example 1
▶I have 3 bags that contain M marbles. Bag i has Ri red and
Bi blue marbles respectively (for i = 1, 2, 3).
▶I choose a bag at random and then draw a marble. What is
the probability that the chosen marble is red ?
▶Solution: P(Red) = P

Example 2
1. If an item is defective, a robot can spot it with 98% accuracy.
2. If an item is not defective, a robot will declare it so with 99%
accuracy.
3. A total of 0.1% items are defective.
4. If the robot says that the item you drew at random is
defective, what is the probability that the robot is correct?
▶P(defective/robot says defective) =
P(robot says defective/defective)P(defective)
P(robot says defective)
▶What is P(robot says defective)?

Bayes rule revisited
Let B1, B2, . . . Bn be the partition of the sample space Ω.
Then for any event A with P(A) > 0 we have
P(Bj/A) =
P(A/Bj)P(Bj)
Pn
i=1 P(A/Bi)P(Bi).
In the marble example, given that the marble drawn is red, what is
the probability that bag 1 was chosen ?

Independence
▶Consider the experiment of tossing a coin and a dice
simultaneously.
▶Identify its underlying probability space.
▶What is P({H, 6})?
▶What is P({T, odd }) = P({∪i=1,3,5{T, i}})?
▶In both cases above we have P(A ∩B) = P(A)P(B).
▶This implies that P(A/B) = P(A).
▶Two events A, B are independent iff P(A/B) = P(A)
and P(B/A) = P(B).
▶Two events A, B are independent iff
P(A ∩B) = P(A)P(B).

Independence
▶Two events A, B are independent if and only if
P(A ∩B) = P(A)P(B).
▶If A and B are independent, then are Ac and Bc independent?
▶What about A and Bc? Are they independent?
▶If A1, A2, . . . , An are independent, then prove that

Mutual and Pairwise Independence
▶A collection of events {Ai, i ∈I} are said to be mutually
independent if the P(∩j∈JAj) = Q
j∈J P(Aj) for any subset J
of I.
▶A collection of events {Ai, i ∈I} are said to be pairwise
independent if any pair of events from the collection are
independent.
▶Mutual independence implies pairwise independence but not
the other way around.
▶HW: Find an example where pairwise independence does not
imply mutual independence.

▶Two events A and B are positively correlated iff
P(A/B) > P(A).
▶Two events A and B are negatively correlated iff
P(A/B) < P(A).
▶A and B have the same correlation as Ac and Bc.
▶A and B have the opposite correlation as A and Bc.
