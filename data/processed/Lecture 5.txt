Motivation to random variables
1 / 29

Random variable
▶Given a random experiment with associated (Ω, F, P), it is
sometimes difficult to deal directly with ω ∈Ω.
eg. rolling a
dice ten times.
▶Notice that each sample point ω ∈Ωis not a number but a
sequence of numbers.
▶Also, we may be interested in functions of these sample points
rather than samples themselves.
eg: Number of times 6
appears in the 10 rolls.
▶In either case, it is often convenient to work in a new simpler
probability space rather than the original space.
▶Random variable is a device which precisely helps us make this
mapping from (Ω, F, P) to a ’simpler’ (Ω′, F′, PX).
▶PX is called as an induced probability measure on Ω′.

Random variable as a measurable function
A random variable X is a function X : Ω→Ω′ that trans-
forms the probability space (Ω, F, P) to (Ω′, F′, PX) and is
‘(F, F′)-measurable’.
▶The map X : Ω→Ω′ implies X(ω) ∈Ω′ for all ω ∈Ω.
▶For event B ∈F′, the pre-image X −1(B) is defined as
X −1(B) := {ω ∈Ω: X(ω) ∈B}
The ‘(F, F′)-measurability’ implies that for every B ∈F ′,
we have X −1(B) ∈F.

Random variable as a measurable function
The ‘(F, F′)-measurability’ implies that for every B ∈F ′,
we have X −1(B) ∈F.
▶Since X −1(B) ∈F, it can be measured using P.
▶What is PX(B) ?
▶PX(B) := P(X −1(B)) for all B ∈F ′.
▶PX(B) is therefore called as the induced probability measure.
▶What if there is no ω ∈Ωsuch that X(ω) ∈B?

Random variables
▶In general, the following convention is followed in most books:
▶Ω′ will be the set of real numbers, denoted by R.
▶F′ as a result will be Borel σ-algebra, denoted by B(R).
▶Remember B(R)?
5 / 29

Borel σ-algebra
▶Borel σ-algebra B(R):
If Ω= R, then B(R) is the event set generated by open sets
of the form (a, b) where a ≤b and a, b ∈R.
▶B(R) contains intervals of the form
[a, b]
[a, b)
(a, ∞)
[a, ∞)
(−∞, b]
(−∞, b)
{a}

A random variable X is a map X : (Ω, F, P) →(R, B(R), PX) such
that for each B ∈B(R), the inverse image X −1(B) := {w ∈Ω:
X(w) ∈B} satisfies
X −1(B) ∈F and
PX(B) = Pr(w ∈Ω: X(w) ∈B)

Random variable
▶If Ω′ is countable, then the random variable is called a
discrete random variable.
▶In this case it is convenient to use F ′ as power-set.
▶If Ω′ ⊆R or uncountable, then the random variable is a
continuous random variable.
▶In this case, F′ = B(R) and the definition is a bit tricky. We
will deal with it later.
▶You can also use Ω′ = R for a discrete random variable and
survive! Lets not get into that.
▶Notation: Random variables denoted by capital letters like
X, Y , Z etc. anf their realizations by small letters x, y, z..

▶{X = 3} is an event in F′.
What is its probability PX({3})?
▶PX({3}) = P({ω ∈Ω: X(ω) = 3}) = P({(1, 2), (2, 1)}).
In general for x ∈Ω′, PX({x}) := P({ω ∈Ω: X(ω) = x}).
Find PX({x}) for all x ∈Ω′?

▶Z =Sum of 4 rolls ?
Ωfor 4 rolls is even complicated.
▶This is where X is useful.
P(Z = 4) = P(X1 = 2, X2 = 2)
▶Here X1 and X2 are independent copies of random variable X.

PMF and CDF
▶
The function pX(x) := PX({x}) for x ∈Ω′ is called as a
probability mass function (PMF) of random variable X.
▶What is the PMF for a random variable corresponding to coin
toss or roll a dice ?
▶
The cumulative distribution function (CDF) is defined
as FX(x1) := P
x≤x1 pX(x) = P{ω ∈Ω: X(ω) ≤x1}.
▶What is the CDF for the random variable corresponding to the
coin toss or dice experiment?

Expectation and Moments
▶How do you define the mean of a collection of numbers?
▶
The mean or expectation of a random variable X is de-
noted by E[X] and is given by E[X] = P
x∈Ω′ xpX(x).
▶What is E[X] for the random variable X that corresponds to
the outcome of coin toss or dice experiment?
▶
The nth moment of a random variable X is denoted by
E[X n] and is given by E[X n] = P
x∈Ω′ xnpX(x).
▶For a function g(·) of a random variable X, its expectation is
given by E[g(X)] := P
x∈Ω′ g(x)pX(x)
