Geometric random variable
▶Consider a biased coin (head with probability p) and suppose
you keep tossing it till head appears the first time.
▶Let random variable N denote the number of tosses needed
for head to appear first time.
▶What is the PMF of N? pN(k) = (1 −p)k−1p.
▶HW: What is E[N], E[N2], Var(N)?
▶What is ¯FN(k) := 1 −FN(k) = P(N > k)?
▶What is P(N > k + m | N > k) ? (= P(N > m))
(memoryless property)

Poisson random variable
▶A Poisson random variable X comes with a parameter λ and
has Ω′ = Z≥0
▶PMF: pX(k) = e−λ λk
k!
▶Intuitively its a limiting case of the Binomial distribution with
n increasing and p decreasing such that np converges to λ.
▶Mean of binomial is np so p should decrease while n increases.
▶Read the Wiki page on Poisson limit theorem.
▶We will see more of this when we see Poisson Prcoesses.

Induced measure PX and CDF
▶The cumulative distribution function (CDF) FX(x) can be
expressed using induced measure PX.
▶Suppose the domain of PX is B(R).
B(R) is made up of sets
of the form (−∞, a] for a ∈R.
▶PX((−∞, x]) = P{w ∈Ω: X(w) ≤x} := FX(x).
▶This is a general definition of CDF (applicable for both
continuous or discrete).
▶If FX(·) is continuous (resp. piecewise continuous), then X is
continuous (resp. discrete) random variable.

For a r.v. X, its CDF satisfies the following
▶FX(∞) = 1 and FX(−∞) = 0 when P(−∞< X < ∞) = 1.
▶FX : R →[0, 1] is non-decreasing and right continuous.
▶At point of discontinuity x we have
1. right hand limit FX(x+) := limϵ↓0 FX(x + ϵ)
2. left hand limit FX(x−) := limϵ↑0 FX(x −ϵ)
3. FX(x−) ̸= FX(x+).
4. FX(x) could be set to either of the two. Which one?
▶Right continuity mandates that at point of discontinuity, we
have FX(x) = FX(x+).
▶By default, FX(x) = FX(x+) = FX(x−) if FX(x) is
continuous at x.

Right-continuity
FX : R →[0, 1] is non-decreasing and right continuous.
Proof
▶Consider a < b where a and b are arbitrary.
We want to
show that FX(a) ≤FX(b).
▶Define A := {ω ∈Ω: X(ω) ≤a}, B := {ω ∈Ω: X(ω) ≤b}.
▶Easy to see that A ⊆B and hence P(A) ≤P(B).
▶FX(a) = PX((−∞, a]) = P(A) ≤P(B) = FX(b).
▶This proves the non-decreasing part.

Right-continuity
FX : R →[0, 1] is non-decreasing and right continuous.
Proof for right-continuity
▶We want to prove that FX(x) = FX(x+).
▶Consider a sequence of numbers {xn} decreasing to x. In this
case, we have FX(x+) = limxn↓x FX(xn).
▶Define An := {ω : X(ω) ≤xn} and A := {ω : X(ω) ≤x}.
▶Is An ↑A or An ↓A ? Clearly, An ↓A.
▶From continuity of probability, limn→∞P(An) = P(A).
▶This implies limxn↓x FX(xn) = FX(x).
▶You cannot prove the other way by considering xn ↑x
because ∪n(−∞, xn] = (−∞, x) and PX(−∞, x) ̸= FX(x).

Continuous random variables
▶A random variable defined on R is discrete, if FX(·) is
piecewise constant.
▶A random variable defined on R is continuous, if FX(·) is a
continuous function.
▶Examples of Continuous random variables
1. Pick a number uniformly from [a, b].
2. Time interval between successive customers entering DMart.
3. Travel time from office to home.
4. Level of water in a dam or pending workload on a server.

Continuous random variables
▶Associated with a continuous random variable is a probability
density function (pdf) fX(x) for all x ∈R.
Its unit is
probability per unit length and is defined as
fX(x)
:=
lim
∆→0+
P(x < X ≤x + ∆)
∆
=
lim
∆→0+
FX(x + ∆) −FX(x)
∆

dFX(x)
dx
.
▶Alternatively, a random variable X is continuous if there exists
a non-negative real valued probability density function (PDF)
fX(·) such that FX(x) =
R x
u=−∞fX(u)du.
dFX(x)
dx
= fX(x) or PX(x < X ≤x + h) ≃fX(x)h.

▶PX(a ≤X ≤b) = PX(a < X < b) = PX(a ≤X < b) = PX(a < X ≤b)
