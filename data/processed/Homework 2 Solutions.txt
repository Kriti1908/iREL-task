Q1: A person has n boxes, where n ≥2. We assume that either a box can have one or
zero items (both cases have equal probability). What is the probability that all of
the boxes contain an item for the following cases:
(a) We pick one box at random and find that it contains an item.
(b) We ask the person, ”Do you have at least one box with a special item?” They
respond, ”Yes!” (Here, assume that if a box contains an item, it has a special
item with probability α ≪1, independently of other boxes.
If the box is
empty, it does not have a special item.)
A:
E1 ⇒Event that the random box we pick has an item
E2 ⇒Event that atleast one of the boxes has a special item
Gi ⇒Event that exactly i boxes have an item
To find: P (Gn | E1) P (Gn | E2)
(a)
P (Gn | E1) = P (Gn ∩E1)
P (E1)
P (E1) =

i=0
P (E1 ∩Gi)
P (E1 ∩Gi) = P (E1 | Gi) P (Gi)
P (E1 ∩G0) = P (E1 | G0) P (G0) = 0
Then,
P (E1 ∩Gi) = P (E1 | Gi) P (Gi)
As we pick the box randomly and it happens to have an item:
P (E1 | Gi) = i
n
Probability of having exactly i boxes with an item inside them:
P (Gi) = 1

So,

(b) Here, we need to find:
P (Gn | E2)
Similar to part (a),
P (E2 ∩Gi) = P (E2 | Gi) P (Gi)
To calculate P (E2 | Gi) we know that the probability that atleast
one box has a special item is the same as the complement of the
probability that no box has a special item.
P (E2 | Gi) = 1 −P (Ec
2 | Gi)
P (Ec

Q2: A coin is tossed n times, what is the probability of getting an odd number of heads
if the probability of getting heads is p.
A: Let P(n) denote the probability of getting an odd number of heads
when a coin is tossed n times.
Base Case:
For n = 1, the probability of getting an odd number of heads is simply
the probability of getting a head:
P(1) = p
Recursive Case:
For n > 1, the probability Pn can be expressed in terms of P(n −1) as
follows:
P(n) = p · (1 −P(n −1) + (1 −p) · P(n −1)
Simplifying, we get:
P(n) = p + (1 −2p) · P(n −1)
Solving the above recursion:
P(2) = p + (1 −2p) · P(1)
P(3) = p + (1 −2p) · P(2)
Substituting,
P(3) = p + (1 −2p) · (p + (1 −2p) · P(1))
Simplifying,
P(3) = p + (1 −2p) · p + (1 −2p)2 · P(1)
By observing the pattern an putting P(1) = p,
P(n) = p+p·(1−2p)+p·(1−2p)2 +· · ·+p·(1−2p)n−2 +(1−2p)n−1 ·p
Solving, using sum of GP,
P(n) = p · (1 −(1 −2p)n)
1 −(1 −2p)
P(n) = 1 −(1 −2p)n

Q3: Harry Potter’s closet contains 12 numbered brooms, of which 8 are Comet Two
Sixty’s (numbered 1 - 8) and 4 are Nimbus Two Thousand’s (Numbered 9-12).
Harry, Ron, George and Fred want to sneak out for a game of Quidditch in the
middle of the night. They don’t want to turn on the light in case Snape catches
them. They reach in the closet and pull out a sample of 4 brooms. Give answers
for both unordered and ordered samples.

(a) How many different samples are possible?
(b) How many samples have exactly one Comet Two Sixty in them?
(c) How many samples have at least 3 Comet Two Sixty’s?
(d) Now, Ginny and Demelza wanna join so they grab 6 brooms, but Demelza
believes that the both teams should have equal number of each type of broom
for the game to be balanced. So, for any broom for a team we would need
another broom of the same type for the other team. How many samples will
keep Demelza happy?
A:
(a)
12C4 = 495
12P4 = 11880
(b)
8C1.4C3 = 32
8C1.4C3.4! = 768
(c)
8C3.4C1 + 8C4.4C0 = 294
(8C3.4C1 + 8C4.4C0).4! = 7056
(d) So, we would need to look at three cases: A = (4Nimbus, 2 Comet),
B = (2 Nimbus, 4 Comet) , C = (6 Comet), since these are mutually
exclusive,
Ans = P(A) + P(B) + P(C)
A = 4C4.8C2 = 28
B = 4C2.8C4 = 420
B = 4C0.8C6 = 28
Total = A + B + C = 28 + 420 + 28 = 476
For ordered since there are 6 elements, and each is numbered, multi-
plying total by 6! accounts for all samples
Total = 6!(476) = 342720
Q4: The Celtics and the Lakers are set to play a playoff series of n basketball games,
where n is odd. The Celtics have a probability p of winning any one game, inde-
pendent of other games.
(a) Find the values of p for which n = 5 is better for the Celtics than n = 3.
(b) Generalize part (a). For any k > 0, find the values for p for which n = 2k + 1
is better for the Celtics than n = 2k −1.

A: a For n = 5 and n = 3, we compare the probabilities of the Celtics
winning the series.
Let P(n) denote the probability of the Celtics winning the series when
there are n games.
For n = 3: The Celtics need to win 2 out of 3 games. The probability is:
P(3) =
2

p2(1 −p)1 + p3 = 2p2(1 −p) + p3
For n = 5: The Celtics need to win 3 out of 5 games. The probability is:

p4(1−p)1 +p5 = 6p3(1−p)2 +4p4(1−p)+p5
To find when n = 5 is better than n = 3, solve:
P(5) > P(3)
6p3(1 −p)2 + 4p4(1 −p) + p5 > 2p2(1 −p) + p3
b
Generalizing the problem to n = 2k + 1 and n = 2k −1:
Let PA be the probability of winning a series of 2k + 1 games and PB be
the probability of winning a series of 2k −1 games. The Celtics need to
win k + 1 out of 2k + 1 games and k out of 2k −1 games.

To determine when PA > PB, we need:

pk(1 −p)k+1
Simplify:
PA −PB =

(k + 1)!(k −1)!pk+1(1 −p)k −(2k −1)!
k!(k −1)!pk(1 −p)k+1
=
(2k)!
(k + 1)k!pk+1(1 −p)k −(2k −1)!
k!(k −1)!pk(1 −p)k+1
=
(2k)!
k!(k + 1)!pk(1 −p)k(2p −1)
Thus, n = 2k + 1 is better than n = 2k −1 if and only if p > 1

Q5: In a company, there are three teams: Team A, Team B, and Team C. Each team
has different success probabilities for their projects:
5

• Team A has a 70% chance of completing a project successfully.
• Team B has a 60% chance of completing a project successfully.
• Team C has a 50% chance of completing a project successfully.
Projects are assigned to these teams with the following probabilities:
• 40% of projects are assigned to Team A
• 35% of projects are assigned to Team B
• 25% of projects are assigned to Team C
Consider a project is completed successfully.
(a) What is the probability that the project was assigned to Team A given that
it was completed successfully?
(b) If you have two projects, what is the probability that both projects are com-
pleted successfully?
(c) Calculate the probability that a project assigned to Team B is not completed
successfully.
(d) Suppose the company has 12 projects to assign, and you want to assign exactly
5 projects to Team A, 4 to Team B, and 3 to Team C. How many different
ways can you assign these projects?
(e) Out of these 12 projects, how many ways can you select 6 projects such that
exactly 3 are from Team A and 3 are from Team B?
A:
(a) To find the probability that the project was assigned to Team A given
that it was completed successfully, use Bayes’ Theorem:
P(A | Success) = P(Success | A) · P(A)
P(Success)
where:
P(Success) = P(Success | A)·P(A)+P(Success | B)·P(B)+P(Success | C)·P(C)
Substituting the values:
P(Success) = 0.70 · 0.40 + 0.60 · 0.35 + 0.50 · 0.25
P(Success) = 0.28 + 0.21 + 0.125 = 0.615
P(A | Success) = 0.70 · 0.40
0.615
= 0.28
0.615 ≈0.456
(b) If the success of each project is independent, the probability that
both projects are completed successfully is:
P(Both Success) = P(Success) × P(Success)
Since the probabilities of success for two randomly chosen projects
depend on their respective probabilities:
P(Both Success) = 0.615 × 0.615 ≈0.378

(c) The probability that a project assigned to Team B is not completed
successfully is:
P(Not Success | B) = 1 −P(Success | B)
P(Not Success | B) = 1 −0.60 = 0.40
(d) To assign 12 projects with 5 to Team A, 4 to Team B, and 3 to Team
C, use the multinomial coefficient:
12!
5!4!3!
Calculating this:
12!
5!4!3! = 479001600
120 · 24 · 6 = 27720
