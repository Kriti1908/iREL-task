Random experiments and Sample space
▶Random experiment : Experiment involving randomness
▶Coin toss
▶Roll a dice
▶Pick a number at random from [0, 1].
▶Sample space Ω: set of all possible outcomes of the random
experiment. It could be a finite or infinite set.
▶Ωc = {H, T}
▶Ωd = {1, 2, . . . , 6}
▶Ωu = [0, 1]
▶Ω2c = {H, T} × {H, T} = {(H, H), (H, T), (T, H), (T, T)}

Outcomes and Events
▶Element ω ∈Ωis called a sample point or possible outcome.
▶A subset A ⊆Ωis called an event.
▶Examples of events
▶Events in the coin experiment: C1 = {T}.
▶Events in the dice experiment: D1 = {6}, D2 = {1, 3, 5}
▶Events in U[0, 1] experiment: U1 = {0.5}, U2 = [.25, .75].
▶In this course, we are interested in probability of events.
▶Probability of event A is denoted by P(A).
▶It may not be possible to measure/assign probability for every
subset A (more later).
▶Any guesses for P(C1), P(D1), P(D2), P(U1) and P(U2) ?

Probability theory
{Random experiment, Sample space, Events} are the key in-
gredients in probability theory.
In probability theory, we are interested in measuring the
probability of subsets of Ω(events).
Probability measure P is a set function, i.e. it acts on sets
and measures the probability of such sets.

Set theory 101
Visualizing operations on events using Venn diagram!
▶Complements: Ac
▶∅denotes empty set.∅⊆A for all A.
▶Union: A ∪B
▶Intersections: A ∩B
▶Difference: A\B
▶Symmetric difference:
▶Mutually exclusive or disjoint events A and B:
▶Identity laws,Complement laws,Associative, Commutative &
Distributive laws, De’Morgans law.

Set theory 101–Cardinality & Countability
▶Cardinality of A is denoted by |A|.
▶Inclusion-exclusion principle |A ∪B| = |A| + |B| −|A ∩B|.
▶Inclusion-exclusion principle for n sets ?
▶Countable sets: Set A is said to be countable if it is either
finite or has 1-1 correspondence with natural numbers N.
▶Uncountable sets: These are sets which are not countable.

Set theory 101 – Monotone sequence of sets
▶Increasing sequence A1 ⊆A2 ⊆A3 . . .
▶Decreasing sequence A1 ⊇A2 ⊇A3 . . .
▶Examples from U[0, 1]:
▶In = [0, 1 −1
n]
▶Dn = [0, 1
n]

Set theory 101 – Cartesian product of sets
▶Cartesian product of sets A and B is denoted by A × B.
▶A × B is itself a set whose members are sets of the form (a, b)
where a ∈A and b ∈B.
▶Suppose A = {1, 3, 5} and B = {2, 4, 6} what is A × B?
▶What is [0, 1] × [0, 1]? unit square!
14 / 73

Set theory 101 – Powersets
Powerset of A is denoted by P(A) is a set whose members
are all possible subsets of A. (P and P are different!)
▶What is P(Ωc) ?
▶What is P(Ωd) ?
▶What is P(Ωu) ?
▶What is the cardinality of P(Ωc), P(Ωd), P(Ωu) ?
▶For discrete sets Ω, often the power set is denoted by 2Ω.

functions and set functions
▶What are functions? Functions are rules or maps that map
elements from a domain D to elements in the range R.
▶f : D →R.
▶Example: f : R →R defined by f (x) = x.
▶Read more on injection, surjection, bijection!
▶What are set functions? these are functions that act on sets
and hence domain D is a collection of sets.
▶Example: length of closed segments on the real line.
▶l : D →R+ where D = {[a, b] : a ≤b, a, b ∈R} and where
l([c, d]) = d −c.

Back to P
▶Why this detour to set theory?
▶Recall that Probability measure P acts on sets and measures
the probability of such sets.
▶In set theory 101 we looked at operations on sets A and B
that gave new sets like A ∪B, A\B, A × B, P(A).
▶So given P(A) and P(B), can we deduce P(A ∪B) or P(A/B)?
▶We want to understand how the probability measure P acts on
sets such as A ∪B, A\B, A × B.

P axioms
Probability measure P is a set function.
Axiom 1: P(∅) = 0, P(Ω) = 1
Axiom 2: For a set A ⊆Ωwe have 0 ≤P(A) ≤1.
Axiom 3: For a disjoint collection of events A1, A2, . . . (where
Ai ⊆Ω)

▶What is in general the domain of P? Ω?
▶P(Ω)? Recall P(Ω) = {A : A ⊆Ω}. Seems like a great
choice!

Towards a formal definition of P
Probability measure P can be defined as a set-function
P : P(Ω) →[0, 1] that satisfies the following 3 axioms.
Axiom 1: P(∅) = 0, P(Ω) = 1
Axiom 2: For a set A ⊆Ωwe have 0 ≤P(A) ≤1.
Axiom 3: For a disjoint collection of events A1, A2, . . . (where
Ai ⊆Ω)

▶Is there a perceivable problem with this definition?
▶The following counter-example will construct a set-function P
for which you cannot assign valid probabilities to every subsets
in Ωwithout violating these axioms.
