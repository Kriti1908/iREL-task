Function of continuous random variables
▶Consider Y = aX + b where X is a continuous random
variable.
▶What is FY (y) and fY (y)?
▶FY (y) = P(Y ≤y) = P(aX + b ≤y).
▶FY (y) = FX( y−b
a ) if a > 0
▶fY (y) = dFY (y)
dy
= 1
afX( y−b
a ) when a > 0
▶FY (y) = 1 −FX( y−b
a ) if a < 0
▶fY (y) = dFY (y)

▶In general, fY (y) =

Function of continuous random variables
Consider Y = aX + b where X is a continuous random vari-
able. Then fY (y) =
1
|a|fX( y−b
a ).
▶What if Y = g(X) where g(·) is continuous, differentiable and
monotone. Any guess?
▶Since g(.) is monotone and continuous it is invertible. Let
h(.) denote the inverse function.
Then h(Y ) = X.
Consider Y = g(X) where g is monotone, continuous, dif-
ferentiable. Then fY (y) = | dh
dy (y)|fX(h(y)) where h is the
inverse function of g.

Function of continuous random variables
Consider Y = g(X) where g is monotone, continuous, dif-
ferentiable. Then fY (y) = fX(h(y))| dh
dy (y)| where h is the
inverse function of g.
Proof:
▶Since g(.) is monotone and continuous it is invertible. Let
h(.) denote the inverse function.
Then X = h(Y ).
▶FY (y) = P(g(X) ≤y).
▶Is P(g(X) ≤y) = P(X ≤h(y)) always?
▶Are the two events {g(X) ≤y} and X ≤h(y) same?
▶If they are same, then the two probabilities are equal.

▶Are the two events {g(X) ≤y} and {X ≤h(y)} same ?
▶Same when g is increasing and compliments when g is
decreasing.

Function of continuous random variables
▶Are the two events {g(X) ≤y} and {X ≤h(y)} same ?
▶Same when g is increasing and compliments when g is
decreasing.
▶CASE 1: g(x) is non-decreasing
▶FY (y) = P(g(X) ≤y) = P(X ≤h(y)) = FX(h(y)).
▶fY (y) = d
dy (FX(h(y))) = fX(h(y)) dh
dy (y) where dh
dy (y) ≥0 as h
is also non-decreasing.
▶Rewritten therefore as fY (y) = fX(h(y))| dh
dy (y)|

Function of continuous random variables
▶Are the two events {g(X) ≤y} and {X ≤h(y)} same ?
▶Same when g is increasing and compliments when g is
decreasing.
▶CASE 2: g(x) is non-increasing
▶FY (y) = P(g(X) ≤y) = P(X > h(y)) = 1 −FX(h(y)).
▶fY (y) = −d
dy (FX(h(y))) = −fX(h(y)) dh
dy (y) where dh
dy (y) ≤0
as h is non-increasing as well.
▶Rewritten therefore as fY (y) = fX(h(y))| dh
dy (y)|.
HW: What about the case when g is not monotone ?
Q: Suppose Y = X 2, then what is fY (y) in terms of fX(x)?

Mixed Random variables
▶Random variables that are neither continuous nor discrete are
called as mixed random variables.
▶Their CDF is partly continuous and partly piece-wise
continuous.
▶Example: X is a U[0, 1] random variable and Y = X if
X ≤0.5 and Y = 0.5 if X > 0.5.
▶What is the CDF and PDF of Y ?

Mixed Random variables
▶Let FY (y) = C(y) + D(y) where C(y) corresponds to the
continuous part and D(y) for the discontinuous part.
▶
E[Y ] =
Z ∞
−∞
xc(x)dx + P
yk
ykP(Y = yk)
where {y1, y2, . . .} are jump points of D(y) where
P(Y = yk) > 0.
▶See section 4.3.1 from probabilitycourse.com for more
examples
▶Amount of workload (pending) on a server!
A server on a
cluster may be idle with a finite probability. If busy, the
pending work is a continuous random variable.

A running example
▶Consider an experiment of tossing a coin and a dice together.
▶Ω= {0, 1} × {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
F = 2Ω.
P(ω) =
1
12.
▶Let X and Y denote the random variables depicting outcome
of a coin and dice respectively.
▶For ω = (1, 5) we have X(ω) = 1 and Y (ω) = 5.
▶We are now interested in the joint PMF pXY (x, y) and joint
CDF FXY (x, y) of X and Y together.
