RECAP
▶We looked at n-length random vectors X which are essentially
multivariate random variables.
▶Its CDF/pdf is simply joint CDF/pdf of components
▶E[X] = [E[X1], . . . E[Xn]].
CX is the covariance matrix.
▶
Let Y = G(X) where G : Rn →Rn, continuous invert-
ible with continuous partial derivatives. Let H denote
its inverse. Then fY(y) = fX(H(y))|J| where J is the
determinant of the Jacobian matrix.
▶If Y = AX + b, then CY = ACXAT and
fY(y) =
1
|det(A)|fX(A−1(y −b))

Standard Normal Vector
▶An n length random vector Z is called as a standard normal
vector if its components Zi are independent and standard
normal.
▶What is E[Z] and CZ ?
▶Show that the pdf is given by
fZ(z) =
1
(2π)n/2 e{−1
2 zT z}

Standard Normal Vector
▶Now suppose X = AZ + µ. What is E[X] and CX?
▶E[X] = µ and CX = AAT.
▶Note that A can have dimension n × l in which case Z is an l
length standard normal.
▶What is fX(x)?

Multivariate Gaussian Vector
▶What is fX(x)?
fX(x)
=
1
|det(A)|fZ(A−1(x −µ))
=
1
(2π)n/2p
det(CX)e{−1
2 (x−µ)T C−1
X (x−µ)}
▶Henceforth we will use the notation Σ to represent CX.
Definition 1: X is multivariate Gaussian with mean vector µ
and covariance matrix Σ (denoted by X ∼N(µ, Σ)) if for
some A and µ, it can be written as X = AZ + µ where Z is
a standard normal vector and Σ = AAT.

Equivalent definitions of a Gaussian vector
The following are equivalent definitions (without proof)
X ∼N(µ, Σ) if for some A and µ, it can be written as
X = AZ + µ
X ∼N(µ, Σ) if it has the pdf
fX(x) =
1
(2π)n/2p
det(Σ)e{−1
2 (x−µ)T Σ−1(x−µ)}
X ∼N(µ, Σ) iff for all vectors a ∈Rn, it turns out that aTX
is univariate Gaussian N(aTµ, aTΣa).

Affine transformations preserve Gaussianity
▶Suppose X ∼N(µ, Σ), then what can we say about
Y = AX + b?
Is it a Gaussian vector ?
▶Easy to see that E[Y] = AE[X] + b and CY = AΣAT.
▶Like in the univariate case, we can use MGF (for multivariate
MGF see Bertsekas) to show the following
Suppose X ∼N(µ, Σ). Now consider Y = AX + b. Then
we have Y ∼N(AE[X] + b, AΣAT).
