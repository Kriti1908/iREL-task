Mutually exclusive and Independence
▶Two events A and B are mutually exclusive if occurrence of
one implies that the other event cannot occur. Are they
independent?
▶If A and B are mutually exclusive, then they are not
independent (and vice versa). This can be seen as follows.
A and B are Mutually Exclusive
▶P(A ∩B) = 0
▶P(A/B) = 0
▶P(A/Bc) = P(A∩Bc)
P(Bc)
=
P(A)
P(Bc)
A and B are Independent
▶P(A ∩B) = P(A)P(B)
▶P(A/B) = P(A)
▶P(A/Bc) = P(A)
▶If A ⊆B, then two events are neither mutually exclusive nor
independent.

Zero probability events and Independence
Zero probability events are always independent!
▶Let E be a zero probability event, i.e. P(E) = 0.
▶Then for any set F, we want to show that P(E ∩F) = 0.
▶Note that E ∩F ⊆E.
▶This implies that P(E ∩F) ≤P(E).

Conditional independence
▶Recall : P(A/B) = P(AB)
P(B) .
▶Also recall : P(A/BC) = P(AB/C)
P(B/C)
▶This implies P(AB/C) = P(A/BC)P(B/C).
Two events A and B are said to be conditionally independent
of event C (P(C) > 0) if P((AB)/C) = P(A/C).P(B/C)
▶As a consequence P(A/BC) = P(A/C)
HW: Verify if events A and B are conditionally independent of
event C (in the experiment of picking number randomly in
{1, .., 10})

Conditional independence – example
▶There are two coins, one fair and other fake (both heads).
The experiment is to choose a coin uniformly and toss twice.
▶Event A: First coin toss results in H. What is its probability?
P(A) = 3/4.
▶Event B: Second coin toss results in H. What is its
probability? P(B) = 3/4.
▶Event C: Coin 1 is chosen.
▶What is P(A/C) and P(B/C)? 1/2
▶What is P((A ∩B)/C)? 1/4 Hence A and B are conditionally
independent given C.
▶Are A and B independent? HW

Principle of counting
▶Given n objects, in how many ways can you arrange them? n!
▶Given n objects, how many distinct pairs can you form?
nC2 =
n
2
 =
n!
n−2!2!.
▶In general, given n objects, we can make
nCk =
n
k
 =
n!
n−k!k!
distinct combination of k objects.
▶Note that in each combination or group of k objects, the
ordering within each group is immaterial. What if we also
want to count this?
▶
nPk =
nCk × k!

Experiments with Sampling
▶Sampling: Sampling from a set means choosing an element
from the set.
▶Sampling uniformly at random: All items in the set have equal
probability of being chosen.
▶Sampling can be with replacement or without replacement.
▶Sampling can be ordered or unordered.
▶In ordered sampling, (a, b, c) ̸= (c, b, a).
▶This leaves us with 4 combinations.
1. Ordered sampling with replacement
2. Ordered sampling without replacement
3. Unordered sampling with replacement
4. Unordered sampling without replacement

Ordered sampling with replacement
▶Suppose you want to sample k out of n objects with
replacement and where the ordering of the k objects matters.
▶Because we sample with replacement, repetition is allowed.
▶How many ways can you choose k objects out of n this way?
▶a) nk?
b)

c) kn
d) nk ?
▶There are k positions and n choices for every position.
▶Total nk.

Ordered sampling without replacement
▶Suppose you want to sample k out of n objects now without
replacement and where the ordering of the k objects matters.
▶Because we sample without replacement, repetition is not
allowed.
▶How many ways can you choose k objects out of n this way?
▶a) nk?

▶There are k positions and n −i + 1 choices for every i th
position.
▶Total n × (n −1) × . . . (n −k + 1) =

Unordered sampling without replacement

Unordered sampling with replacement
▶Here you want to sample k out of n objects with replacement
and the ordering of the k objects does not matters.
▶Because we sample with replacement, repetition is allowed.
▶How many ways can you choose k objects out of n this way?
▶In any such sampling, any object i can appear atmost k times.
▶Let xi denote the number of times object i is chosen in k
samples.

are 3! × 2! different distinguished arrangements.
